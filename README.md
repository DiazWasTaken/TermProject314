What was your motivation?
- The motivation for this project was mainly since it was part of a term long project. As I sunk deeper into the project and issues arose, I dove deeper into the backend of Javascript through
  node.js and used previous aspects of coding I have never gone into, my interest piqued - although too late.

Why did you build this project?
- As stated previously, this project was built to complete a term long project for a college course. This project was developed in order to have a “taste” of what it feels like to actively
  develop and ship a product within computer science careers, which I personally had not experienced before hand.

What problem does it solve?
- This project does not set out to solve anything. If you consider a school project as being a problem that needs to be solved then
  that would be the reason for this project existing. But to not have such a trivial solution, the problem could be encapsulated as having a lack of information, and the program solves this by teaching us the knowledge we need at each obstacle during the process.

What did you learn?
- Through this project, javascript, deploying a web application (through render.com), implementing a database (mongodb), and applying an
  authentication service (Auth0). Each of these learning steps had their own hurdles that needed time in order to find and implement their solutions.
